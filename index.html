          <h1>Making Sense of Ferguson</h1>
          <p>After waking up on the morning of August 9th, 2014, 28-year-old police officer <span class="context">Darren Wilson</span> pulled on a pair of navy blue pants and buttoned up his matching French blue uniform shirt. A Ferguson Police Department badge was stitched on both shoulders, and his name rested just above the right breast pocket. He also wore his standard duty belt: magazine pouches, mace on the left, a baton, two sets of handcuffs, his radio, and a firearm on the right, a Sig Sauer P229 .40 Caliber.</p>
          <p>It was early-his shift started that day at 6:30 am, but Wilson didn't mind. He'd had his share of ups and downs, but being a police officer for the past five years was the job of his life, he'd later say. On February 11th, 2014, his father, John Wilson, posted a picture&nbsp;of his son on Facebook&nbsp;receiving an award for subduing a suspected drug dealer until assistance arrived. A large amount of marijuana was recovered from the car. "Very proud of my son, Darren Wilson, on his receiving a Commendation from his Police Department. Congratulations Son," his father typed with pride. Later, the photo would be scavenged by a fleet of internet trolls and sent to "<em>Yahoo!News</em>," where it would then be posted and used to alert the country of whom Wilson was, and what he looked like.</p>
          <p>Later that morning, Wilson went to the pharmacy to pick up some heartburn medication for his fiancee, 37-year-old Barbara Spradling, also a Ferguson police officer. In 2012, Spradling was awarded a Medal of Valor for helping detain and negotiate a peaceful surrender with a car robbery suspect, who had fired gunshots at her and another officer. Wilson and Spradling lived together in a one-story brick house in Crestwood, Missouri, with a pool and a basketball hoop. Potted plants and a garden hose sat out front.</p>
          <p>It was hot on the morning of August 9th, but strangely it wasn't oppressively humid in St. Louis that day, which Wilson noted as he patrolled the area in a marked Chevy Tahoe. Midmorning, he was dispatched to attend to a three-month-old baby, whose parents had reported that the infant was having difficulty breathing. 911 calls in the area first go to the Ferguson Police Department, which then forwards the call to paramedics and dispatches a police car to arrive with the ambulance. "It is an anti-police area for sure," Wilson later said of Ferguson, while testifying in front of a grand jury about a month later on September 16th. "There's a lot of violence in that area, there's a lot of gun activity, drug activity. It is just not a very well-liked community. That community doesn't like the police â€¦ There are good people over there, there really are, but I mean there is an influx of gang activity in that area."</p>

          <p>At 12:01 pm, Wilson first came in contact with two young black men walking down Canfield Drive. He didn't learn their names until the next day. One of the teenagers, 18-year-old Michael Brown, lived in Ferguson with his grandmother. Wilson's DNA would later be found on Brown's left palm. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, had him when she was 16, but she was determined to get her son to graduate from high school and attend college. Brown had just graduated from Normandy High School that May, unlike 40% of his classmates, who had not.</p>
